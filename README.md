## Usage

1. **Enter Locations:**  
   - Type each location on a new line.  
   - *Tip:* Use the AI generator by entering a keyword (e.g., "location", "marvel-characters") and clicking "Generate list by ai" for instant ideas.
2. **Enter Players:**  
   - Input player names separated by spaces or new lines.  
   - **Note:** Player names cannot contain spaces.
3. **Choose Number of Spies:**  
   - Set the number of spies for this round (minimum 1, up to the number of players).
4. **Start Game:**  
   - Click "Start Game." Pass the device to each player and let them reveal their secret role.
   - Spies will see their status (and, if more than one, their fellow spies). Others see the secret location.
5. **Play:**  
   - Ask questions, try to blend in or catch the spy!

### Game Rules

- One or more players are randomly assigned as spies; others know the same secret location.
- Players ask one another questions about the location. The spy tries to guess the location without being discovered.
- At any time, players may vote on who they think the spy is, or the spy may try to guess the location.
- **Locations:** Each location must be on a separate line.  
  *Need ideas?* Use the built-in AI generator!
- **Player Names:** No spaces allowed (use underscores or dashes if needed).
